Description: A problem when recording 3D fluorescent microscopy images
        is how to properly present these results in 2D. Maximum
        intensity projections are a popular method to determine the
        focal plane of each pixel in the image. The problem with this
        approach, however, is that out-of-focus elements will still be
        visible, making edges and fine structures difficult to detect.
        This package aims to resolve this problem by using the contrast
        around a given pixel to determine the focal plane, allowing for
        a much cleaner structure detection than would be otherwise
        possible. For convenience, this package also contains functions
        to perform various other types of projections, including a
        maximum intensity projection.
